# LinkedIn Founder Profile Scraper & Analyzer

This project scrapes LinkedIn profiles of founders based on a provided list of URLs and then performs a basic analysis on the collected data.

## Features

*   Logs into LinkedIn using provided credentials.
*   Scrapes key information from founder profiles: Name, Headline, Experience, Education.
*   Handles potential variations in LinkedIn profile structures using multiple selectors.
*   Saves scraped data to a CSV file.
*   Analyzes the scraped data to provide summaries (e.g., average experience, common schools/degrees).
*   Includes basic logging to `linkedin_scraper.log`.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   Google Chrome browser installed
*   LinkedIn Account

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd linkedinScraper 
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory.
    *   Add your LinkedIn credentials to the `.env` file:
        ```dotenv
        LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your_linkedin_email@example.com
        LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_linkedin_password
        ```
    *   **Important:** Ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing your credentials.

## Usage

1.  **Prepare Input File:**
    *   Create a CSV file named `your_file.csv` (or modify the `input_csv_path` variable in `linkedinFounderScraper.py`).
    *   This file should contain a header (e.g., `linkedin_url`) and a list of LinkedIn profile URLs, one per row.
    *   Example `your_file.csv`:
        ```csv
        linkedin_url
        https://www.linkedin.com/in/founder1/
        https://www.linkedin.com/in/founder2/
        ```

2.  **Run the Scraper:**
    *   Execute the scraper script:
        ```bash
        python linkedinFounderScraper.py
        ```
    *   The script will log in, navigate to each profile URL, scrape the data, and save it to `founder_profile_data.csv`.
    *   Check `linkedin_scraper.log` for progress and potential errors.
    *   **Note:** LinkedIn might require CAPTCHA verification or have security measures that can interrupt the scraping process. The script includes delays, but manual intervention might occasionally be needed. Be mindful of LinkedIn's terms of service regarding scraping.

3.  **Run the Analysis:**
    *   Once the scraper has finished and `founder_profile_data.csv` is created, run the analysis script:
        ```bash
        python analysis.py
        ```
    *   The script will read the CSV, process the data, and print summary statistics to the console.
